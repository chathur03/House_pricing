This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a basic workflow for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Load and preprocess the housing dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
3. Handle categorical and numerical features.
4. Remove outliers from the dataset.
5. Scale numerical features.
6. Split the data into training and testing sets.
7. Train a linear regression model.
8. Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
9. Visualize the results.
